 * pandago API
 * # About The pandago API provides system-to-system integration to facilitate on-demand courier delivery service requests. Each integration is scoped as a specific Brand using a ClientID. Each delivery request will be called an Order.  ## Client Client represents a single integration for a specific Brand. Client information will include the following: * Customer known name of the Brand/Branch * Address of the Brand/Branch that includes Latitude and Longitude.  A Client would typically represent a logistical system that manages a Brand with a few branch locations. This system will usually manage or will need an order allocation to distribute order to its branches. The pandago API supports dynamic pick-up location that allows orders to be picked up from any branch location.  ### Integration Step(s) 1. Register a Client as a Brand with pandago. 2. Register all Branches/Outlets which relates to the Brand.     *Note: Accuracy of branchâ€™s latitude and longitude is important for the branch matching process* 3. Use the same ClientID when submitting orders from any branch within the registered Brand. ### Ordering Step(s) 1. The Sender address must be specified when submitting an Order.     The Sender latitude and longitude will be used to find the matching Branch/Outlet with a tight tolerance.     *Note: system will reject the order when it fails to find the matching Branch/Outlet latitude and longitude.*  ## Order Order is the principal object that encompasses the package delivery process from the start to the end. Once a new order is submitted, pandago will respond with the order details and will start looking for an available courier. OrderID should be used to get updates on the order status.  ### Status Updates Order status updates can be obtained from the following method: 1. Push method     A Callback URL can be provided as part of the Client information. This will allow the pandago API to push status updates to the Callback URL. 2. Pull method     A Get Order endpoint can be pulled periodically to get the latest status.  ### Available Statuses | Status | Description | | - | - | | NEW | Order has been created | | RECEIVED | We've accepted the order and will be assigning it to a courier | | WAITING_FOR_TRANSPORT | Looking for a courier to pick up and deliver the order | | ASSIGNED_TO_TRANSPORT | Assigning order to a courier | | COURIER_ACCEPTED_DELIVERY | Courier accepted to pick up and deliver the order | | NEAR_VENDOR | Courier is near the pick-up point | | PICKED_UP | Courier has picked up the order | | COURIER_LEFT_VENDOR | Courier has left from pick-up point | | NEAR_CUSTOMER | Courier is near the drop-off point | | DELIVERED | Courier has delivered the order | | DELAYED | Order delivery has been delayed and estimated delivery time has been updated | | CANCELLED | Order has been cancelled | *Note: Please accept other statuses that are not currently listed above, a new status might be introduce in the future*  ### Supported Payment Methods | Payment Method | Description | | - | - | | PAID | Order has been fully paid already and courier will not collect any amount from the end customer | | CASH_ON_DELIVERY | Courier will collect payment (order amount) from the end customer upon delivery | *Note: For the billing of the pandago delivery fee, this will be settled separately according to the agreed billing schedule and process*  # Getting Started These are the steps to start using the pandago API: 1. Generate Key Pair (Private Key and Public Key) to support secure communication with the pandago API.     Follow these commands on a terminal:    ```    # Generate private key    # output: client.pem file    openssl genrsa -out client.pem 2048     # Generate public key from the generated private one    # input: client.pem file    # output: client.pub file    openssl rsa -in client.pem -pubout > client.pub    ```    Or, follow these steps:    1. Open a browser and access this Online RSA Generator (https://cryptotools.net/rsagen)    2. Select key length to 2048 bit, and click the Generate Key Pair button.    3. Copy and save the Private Key to a file with .pem extension (e.g. client.pem).    4. Copy and save the Public Key to a file with .pub extension (e.g. client.pub). 2. Contact a pandago representative stating your interest in using the pandago API and provide the following information:    1. Public Key (file: client.pub)    2. Brand or Branch details:       | Attribute | Description | Example |       | - | - | - |       | Name | Customer known name for your Brand or Branch | Store ABC |       | Address | Address of your Brand or Branch. This address will be used as default sender. | 12 Street 3 unit #4-56 |       | Latitude | Latitude of the Address | 1.2867416 |       | Longitude | Longitude of the Address | 103.8523024 |       | Callback URL | [OPTIONAL] The Callback URL for pushing Order statuses must be an HTTPS with valid SSL certificate. See: Order Status Callback | https://example.io/update |  3. The pandago representative will provide you with ClientID, KeyID and Scope that your service will need to generate an Access Token for thepandago API.    | Attribute | Description | Example |    | - | - | - |    | ClientID | Your service identifier| pandago:sg:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 |    | KeyID | Your public key identifier| 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 |    | Scope | Access scope of your service| pandago.api.sg.* |
