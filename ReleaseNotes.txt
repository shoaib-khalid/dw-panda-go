1. Uses logback to write logs to desired directory, follows this tutorial: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-logging
2. Configures logback file's path through run.sh
3. Uses a sample controller to receive a sample http GET request and prints logs
4. The main file should be in the top most package for spring application to work properly, i.e. all the other packages should be on a lower hierarical level than the main package which has the main class.
5. logback-spring.xml and application.properties is placed in the root folder of the project and not in the resources folder.
6. If logback-spring.xml file's path is passed via the "logback.configurationFile" variable while starting the vm, like this: java -jar -Dlogback.configurationFile=./logback-spring.xml spring-boot-sample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, it will not work for spring. To make it work for spring it needs to be specified in the application.properties file like this: logging.config=./logback-spring.xml
7. Following is the block in pom.xml which is written to copy the application.properties and logback-spring.xml to the target (output) directory:
